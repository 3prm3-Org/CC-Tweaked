edit is a text editor for creating or modifying programs or text files. After creating a program with edit, type its filename in the shell to run it. You can open any of the builtin programs with edit to learn how to program.

ex:
"edit hello" opens a file called "hello" for editing.

By changing setting "edit.advanced_functionality" to true you can unlock ability to jump to specific line in longer files.
