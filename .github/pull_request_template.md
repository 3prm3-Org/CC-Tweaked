Unless this feature is specific to CC:Tweaked, try to [target the original ComputerCraft repo](https://github.com/dan200/ComputerCraft/) instead. There's a lot more people watching it, so it allows the wider community to contribute.

## Useful information to include:
 - Brief explanation of the changes you've made.
 - Rationale of why this change has been made/reasoning behind it.

The more information you can provide, the easier it is to review something now _and_ to see why a change was made, when the code needs updating in the future.
